# How to write Docker Compose
Latest Info @ https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-application-model/

The typical structure of a docker-compose file is as follows
```yml
version: "3"

services: 
	...
	...

networks: 
	...
	...

volumes:
	...
	...
	
configs:
	...
	...

secrets
	...
	...

```

It starts with Docker Compose version and consists of all the assets requires to configure the app environment, divided into following groups:

- `services` : Computing components of an application. Basically, Containers.
- `networks` : Services communicate via networks.
- `volumes` : Services store and share persistent data into volumes.
- `configs`
- `secrets`

#### `services` 

A general definition of a service in a docker-compose file is as follows

```yml
services: 
	<NAME 1>:
		container_name: <CUSTOM_NAME>
		image: <IMAGE NAME>
		ports:
	      - "443:8043"
	      - "8080:8080"
	    networks:
	      -frontend
	      -backend
		volumes:
	      - db-data:/etc/data
		environment:
	       USERNAME: thekarananand
	       PASSWORD: awesome123
	    restart: always
		depends_on:
		  - <NAME 2>
	
	<NAME 2>:
		...
		...
	
	<NAME 3>:
		...
		...
```
here,
- `restart: "always"` -> container start automatically when it exits/dies
- instead of `image: <IMAGE NAME>`, a dockerfile can be used by `build: <PATH>`

#### `networks` 

A general definition of a network in a docker-compose file is as follows
```yml
networks: 
	<NET NAME 1>:
		name: <CUSTOM_NAME>
		ipam:
			driver: <NET-DRIVER>
			config:
			  - subnet: "182.18.0.0/24"
	
	<NAME 2>:
		...
		...
	
	<NAME 3>:
		...
		...
```
here
- `driver: <NET-DRIVER>`  can be `default` (which is `bridge`)or any other default type network

#### `volumes`
