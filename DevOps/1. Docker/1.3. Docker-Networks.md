# Docker Networks

#### There are 3 Default Networks

1. `bridge` : Default Network, all container on same network (generally, `172.17.xx.xx`) 
2. `none` : Connected to no network. No Internet, as well
3. `host` : Essentially, The Container is connected to Docker Host's network. So, the container will listen to same ports on Docker Host. This implies that we can't have 2 containers on host network listening to same port.

#### Set Networks for a Container
```bash
docker run --network <NETWORK NAME> <IMAGE NAME>
```

#### List Networks
```bash
docker network ls
```

#### User Defined Network
```bash
docker network create \
	--driver <NETWORK TYPE> \
	--subnet <SUBNET> \
	[--gateway <GATEWAY>] \
	<NETWORK NAME>
```
here,
- `<NETWORK TYPE>` is generally, `bridge`
- `<SUBNET>` can be `182.18.0.0/16`

#### Embedded DNS
Allows Container to communicate to each other by just using "Container Name". 

Docker's built-in DNS functionality for container name resolution only works on user-defined custom bridge networks, not on the default bridge network named "bridge" or "docker0".
