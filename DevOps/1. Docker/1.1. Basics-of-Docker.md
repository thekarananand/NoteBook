# Pull Images & Spin Containers

#### Pull A Docker Image
```bash
docker pull <IMAGE NAME>[:<TAG>]
```
here,
- `<TAG>` is used to specify the version.
#### Run A Docker Container
```bash
docker run [-i] [-t] [-d] [-p <H>:<C>] [--name <NAME>] [-e PASS=awesome1234] <IMAGE NAME> <COMMAND>
```
here,
- NOTE : if the specified image is not available locally, docker will automatically grab it from dockerhub
- `-i` flag is used to run the container in interactive mode.
- `-t` flag is to open TTY session.
- `-d` flag is to run the container in detach mode (Run container in background)
- `[-p <H>:<C>]` flag is for Port Forwarding from Container‚Äôs Port `<C>` to Host‚Äôs port `<H>`
- `[--name <NAME>]` flag is for adding a custom name to the container.
- `<COMMAND>` can be an actual command for the container to run. if `-d` flag is not used then, output from the container will be displayed. After the execution of the command ended, the container will stop
- `[-e PASS=awesome1234]` sets an environment variable to container

# List Stuff

#### List local Docker Images
**Command 1**
```bash
docker images
```
**Command 2**
```bash
docker image 
```
#### List local Containers
There are two commands for the same task.
**Command 1 :**
```bash
docker container ls [-a] [-q]
```

**Command 2 :**
```bash
docker ps [-a] [-q]
```
here,
- `-a` flag is used to list all running containers + stopped containers
- `-q` flag is used to list only Container ID

---
# Control Existing Docker-stuff
#### Start an existing Container
```bash
docker start <CONTAINER ID> 
```
here,
- `<CONTAINER ID>` can be fetched by `docker ps` command.

#### Stop a Container

**Command 1 : For Multiple Containers**
```bash
docker kill <CONTAINER ID> [<CONTAINER ID1> <CONTAINER ID2> ...]
```

**Command 2 :**
```bash
docker stop <CONTAINER ID>
```
here,
- `<CONTAINER ID>` can be fetched by `docker ps` command.

---
#### Execute Something in an existing Container
There are two commands for the same task.

**Command 1 :**
```bash
docker exec [-i] [-t] [-d] <CONTAINER ID> <COMMAND>
```

**Command 2 :**
```bash
docker container exec [-i] [-t] [-d] <CONTAINER ID> <COMMAND>
```
here,
- `-i` flag is used to run the container in interactive mode.
- `-t` flag is for TTY.
- `-d` flag is to run the container in detach mode (Run container in background)
- `<CONTAINER ID>` can be fetched by `docker ps` command.
- `<COMMAND>` can be an actual command for the container to run, or Commend shell can be fetched by `docker ps` command.  If `-d` flag is not used then, output from the container will be displayed.
#### Display Logs of a Container
```bash
docker logs [--since <time>] <CONTAINER ID> 
```
here,
- `<CONTAINER ID>` can be fetched by `docker ps` command.
- `[--since <time>]` is used to show logs since the given time.

#### Inspect Containers / Images
```bash
docker inspect <IMAGE ID/CONTAINER ID>
```

# Remove Stuff

#### Remove Containers
**Command 1 :**
```bash
docker rm <CONTAINER ID>
```

**Command 2 : To remove all containers**
```bash
docker container prune [-f]
```
here,
- `<CONTAINER ID>` can be fetched by `docker ps` command.
- `-f` = Force.

#### Remove a Docker Image
```bash
docker rmi <IMAGE NAME> [-f]
```
here,
- `-f` = Force.
- NOTE : if the container of an image is running, then the image can‚Äôt be removed
