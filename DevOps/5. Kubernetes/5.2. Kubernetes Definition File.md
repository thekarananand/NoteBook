# Kubernetes Definition File

In a Kubernetes Definition file, there are 4 Top Level \ Root Level properties. All of these properties are required:

``` yml
apiVersion:
kind:
metadata:
	...
	...
spec:
	...
	...
```
#### apiVersion & kind
| `kind`     | `apiVersion` |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Pod        | v1           |
| Service    | v1           |
| ReplicaSet | apps/v1      |
| Deployment | apps/v1      |
- `kind` defines the resource type
### metadata
```
metadata:
	name: <OBJECT NAME>
	labels:
		<ANY SET OF `KEY: VALUE` PAIR>
```

`labels` helps us to group different kubernetes objects. `labels` on an existing kubernetes object can be access by using `kubectl describe` command.
example of `labels`:
``` yml
	labels:
		type: PRO-MAX
		boss: Karan
```

## Create Pods: Definition File

``` yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	...
	...
	
spec:
	containers:
		- name: <CONTAINER NAME>
		  image: <IMAGE>
```
---
## Create ReplicaSet: Definition File
Also : [[5.3. Scaling#Scaling a ReplicaSet]]

``` yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
	...
	...
	
spec:
	template:
		<METADATA & SPEC OF PODS>
	
	replicas: <NUMBER OF REPLICAS>
	
	selector: 
		matchLabels:
			<APPROPRIATE LABELS>

```
#### template
- **NOTE**: in template > metadata, `name` property is useless.
- example of `template`: 
```yaml
spec:
	template:
		metadata:
			label:
				<LABELS>
		spec:
			containers:
			  - name: <CONTAINER NAME>
			    image: <IMAGE>
```
#### selector
- `selector`, is a required property in `ReplicaSet`.
- It specifies how to identify Pods it can acquire.
- if any pods acquired by a `ReplicaSet` exits, it spins a new pods with specs defined in `template` property of that `ReplicaSet`

## Create Deployment: Definition File
Also : [[5.4. Updates#Triggering a Rollout]]

Same as ReplicaSet.... Only Difference is `kind: Deployment`. In production, `Deployment` is more preferred due to more number of features.
