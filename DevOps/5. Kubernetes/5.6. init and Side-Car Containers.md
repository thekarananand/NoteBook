# init and Side-Car Containers

## init Containers

- Init containers are special containers that run to completion before the main application container starts in a pod.

- They are useful for various tasks such as:
	- Setting up the file system for the application container.
	- Downloading and installing dependencies.
	- Performing checks to ensure certain conditions are met before starting the main container.


#### Create init Containers: Definition File
```yml
apiVerion: v1
kind: Pod

metadata:
	name: <SERVICE NAME>
	label:

spec:
	containers:
		- name: <CONTAINER NAME>
		  image: <IMAGE>
	
	initContainers:
		- name: <CONTAINER NAME>
		  image: <IMAGE>
		  command:
			  - echo
			  - "hey"
		
		- name: <CONTAINER NAME>
		  image: <IMAGE>
		  command:
			  - echo
			  - "hey"
```

- They run sequentially, and the main containers will only start after all init containers have finished successfully.

## Side-Car Containers

#### Multi-container pods

- A multi-container pod can run multiple containers together on a single Kubernetes node.
- There are several use cases for multi-container pods, including:
    - The sidecar pattern, where a helper container provides additional functionality to the main application container (e.g., logging, proxying).
    - Sharing data between containers using volumes.
