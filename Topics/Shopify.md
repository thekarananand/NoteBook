# Selecting a Shopify Plan 

General Rule for Selecting a Plan,

$$
\frac{ \text{ Difference in Shopify Plan Price } }{ \text{ Difference in Conversion fee Rate } } < \text{ Average Monthlty Revenue }
$$

If $\text{Difference in Conversion fee Rate}$  is $2\% - 0.5\% = 1.5\%$, then Denominator will be $0.015$

> [!For Context]
> $$
> \text{ Revenue } = \text{ Number of Units sold } \times \text{ Average Sale Price } 
> $$ 

For a Beginner, as there is no sales volume, Go for **Basic Plan**.
